# Ruby

Today, I have decided to choose Ruby as my core competency. So far I have never been able to tell anyone that I am really good at one thing. I was never a specialist. That is not to say I was good at many things. I always got distracted by the next shiny thing, so I never got really good at one thing.

This is a small step towards becoming good at one thing. I will become a Ruby expert! Ruby, I choose you!
